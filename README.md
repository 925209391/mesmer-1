# MESMER

***THIS README.md FILE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.***

**`MESMER`** (Muon Electron Scattering with Multiple Electromagnetic Radiation) is a Monte Carlo event generator for high-precision simulation of muon-electron scattering at low enegies

### Authors
**`MESMER`** is developed at INFN, Sezione di Pavia, and Department of Physics, Universit√† di Pavia (Italy).  
Authors are listed in the file [`AUTHORS`](AUTHORS.md).

### Citing the code
We'd be grateful if you could cite the following papers when using the **`MESMER`** generator:  
1. [Carloni Calame *et al.*, Towards muon-electron scattering at NNLO, JHEP 11 (2020) 028](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1805205)  
2. [Alacevich *et al.*, Muon-electron scattering at NLO, JHEP 02 (2019) 155](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1703989)

## Prerequisites & Compilation
The program is mainly written in `Fortran 77` and it has been tested with `GCC` compilers.

Three external libraries are used, [`LoopTools`](http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/), [`Collier`](https://collier.hepforge.org/) and
the `C` implementation of [`RANLUX`](https://luscher.web.cern.ch/luscher/ranlux/), shipped with the code under GPL-like licences. To be compiled,
the `Collier` library requires the availability of the `cmake`.

The interface to Cern ROOT event format requires the [`ROOT`](https://root.cern/) framework to be installed.

A `Makefile` is provided and the executable `mesmer` is build by simply issuing the command `make`.
