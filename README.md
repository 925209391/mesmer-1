**MESMER** (Muon Electron Scattering with Multiple Electromagnetic Radiation) is a Monte Carlo event generator for high-precision simulation of muon-electron scattering at low enegies

## Prerequisites & Compilation
The program is mainly written in Fortran 77 and it has been tested with GCC compilers.

Three external libraries are used, [`LoopTools`](http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/), [`Collier`](https://collier.hepforge.org/) and
the `C` implementation of [RANLUX](https://luscher.web.cern.ch/luscher/ranlux/), shipped with the code under GPLs licences. The `Collier` library
requires the availability of the `cmake` command to be compiled.

The interface to Cern ROOT event format requires the [ROOT](https://root.cern/) framework to be installed.

A `Makefile` is provided and the executable `mesmer` is build by simply issuing the command `make`.
