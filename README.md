## Prerequisites & Compilation
The program is mainly written in Fortran 77 and it has been tested with GCC compilers.

Two external libraries are used, [LoopTools](http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/) and [Collier](https://collier.hepforge.org/), shipped with the code
under LGPL and GPLv3 licenses respectively. The latter requires the availability of the `cmake` command to be compiled.

The interface to Cern ROOT event format requires the [ROOT](https://root.cern/) suite to be installed.

A `Makefile` is provided and the executable `mesmer` is build by simply issuing the command `make`.
